# List of Fabric GameProviders

[Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader) is an amazing tool. Not only is it the best tool for Minecraft modding, but it can even be taken further! \
Here's a list of external GameProviders that I've compiled on my own:

## Minicraft

## Infinite Tux

*ExampleGameProvider is a template GameProvider, using Infinite Tux as an example game, in the hopes that others would learn from it, and make their own providers.* \

# What is a GameProvider?
Fabric Loader isn't just a Minecraft modding toolchain, Fabric Loader can actually run pretty much any Java-based game if you tell it how to. A GameProvider is what we use to do just that. Fabric Loader has a MinecraftGameProvider built-in, but that doesn't mean that's all it can do. Just by making a new GameProvider for another Java-based game, you can enable the creation and use of Fabric mods for that game, targetting that game. I really hope to see this facet of Fabric Loader's potential be explored more, and I will do what I can to encourage more GameProvider development.
